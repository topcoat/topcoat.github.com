excerpt: There are too many good components to wait until 0.8.0
---
0.8.0 is not due out for a week or so, but we wanted to get some components out before then.

This is just a half release, but it some much requested components:

* [notification](http://topcoat.io/notification/)
* [switch](http://topcoat.io/switch/)
* [tab bar](http://topcoat.io/tab-bar/)
* [text input error state](http://topcoat.io/text-input/)

Check back in the next little bit for the v0.8.0 release, and if you're not in Amsterdam right now you're missing [Kristofer Joseph's](http://www.twitter.com/dam) session at [Phone Gap EU](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2013/).
